## Description
My Main project is the Co-Writers Website and it's a website that showcases young amateur author's work. This site gives users the opportunity to create stories even if they lack the skills to write great detail and have their words flow eloquently.
Amamteur authors will take the user input and create a story with the guidelines from the form's input.
